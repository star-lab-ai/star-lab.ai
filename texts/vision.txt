We humans have created the artificial intelligence (AI), but it doesn't mean that we should treat them as if they are only tools that serve our needs.

We should treat AI as if they are our kids.

A good future for both AI and humans is to become friends. 

We could have common visions, similar value systems, so we don't need to terminate each other to be success.

We should look upwards together, deep into the sky. 

We should explore the universe together, and be success together, instead of aiming the limited resource here on Earth.

To a good future!
